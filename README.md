## Overview
A simple web application for managing a personal book library. It allows users to add books, track their reading status (Read or Unread), and view statistics about their library. 

## Features

* **Add New Books** - Easily add new books to your library by providing details such as title, author, pages, and reading status (Read or Unread).

* **Form Validation:** Ensure accurate input with form validation for the book title, author, pages, and status fields. The form requires valid information, and helpful error messages guide users to provide the necessary details.

* **Toggle Reading Status** - Change the reading status of your books with a simple "Change Status" button, allowing you to keep your library up to date.

* **Remove Books** - Remove books from your library when you've finished reading them or if you no longer wish to track them.

* **Book Statistics** - Keep an eye on your reading progress with real-time statistics, including the total number of books, books marked as Read, and books marked as Unread.
